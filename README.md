# GifTastic
This application uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. Choose a search item, and watch as the application renders and displays the gif you chose! Toggle between button choices and click the images to see your GIFs come to life. As a bonus, we've included the rating (PG, G, etc.) of each GIF as well (for the youngins).

### Instructions
